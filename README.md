# Archived

This project was started to play around with the [IGDB API](https://api.igdb.com/), specifically a site to display the game engine that a game was built with. Unfortunately that part of the database was not well fleshed out so I ended up stopping the project. It looks like Twitch has since taken control of the database/API so maybe its a bit more robust now.
